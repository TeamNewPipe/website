# The Hitchhiker's Guide to Commenting

Our blog features a comment system. Comments are moderated, which means that they're not immediately published, but reviewed first.

To make our moderation work as transparent as possible, we publish our rules for comments on this page. We provide a detailed reasoning for every rule.


## Overview

1. Comments must be related to the content of the page
1. Comments may not be offensive or harassing
1. Comments must not offend laws in Germany or the European Union
1. Spam or otherwise malicious content is not permitted


## Comments must be related to the content of the page

We see a lot of comments of people looking for help, trying to suggest features, report bugs, complain about the app in general, etc. Those, however, are not related to the content in any way.

We welcome discussions on new features or other changes below release posts, for instance. However, what regularly happens is that critical, constructive posts are lost between tens or hundreds of others, which discuss anything but the content.

Therefore, we are no longer going to publish comments unrelated to the sites in order to provide more space for feedback on the actual content.


## Comments may not be offensive or harassing

Normally, it should be a matter of course to refrain from hate speech, offensive or harassing language, insults, intimidation and alike. As a very small share of commenters does not adhere to what we consider common sense, though. Therefore, we want to emphasize that we forbid such content.


## Comments must not offend laws in Germany or the European Union

The website is hosted within the European Union, on a server in Germany. Therefore, we make sure laws in these jurisdictions are not offended by comments.


## Spam or otherwise malicious content is not permitted

Spam, as commonly defined, is not permitted in comments. Same goes for malicious content of all kinds.

Some examples for prohibited content:

* ads
* malware, phishing, and alike
* extremism of any kind
* answers to comments which are clearly unrelated
* repetitions of already-posted comments
