title: "What's New feed not sorted correctly"
---
<section>
    <p class="text-info">The "What's New" feed shows the latest video from each channel you subscribed to.</p>
    <p>Due to the algorithm which is used right now, it is not possible to get the exact release time of a video.
    As a consequence, the feeds are sorted by date but not by date time.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>There is an open pull request which addresses this problem. We hope to get it through as soon as possible.</p>
