    <p>NewPipe supports Android phones and tablets, as well as TVs running Android/Google TV.</p>
    <p>On some devices, it may be beneficial to change the appearance manually. This can be done by changing <code class="code-bg-light"><img src="/img/icons/baseline-settings-20px.svg" class="baseline-settings" /> Settings > 
       <img src="/img/icons/color_lens-20px.svg" class="baseline-settings" /> Appearance > List view mode</code>, which can be toggled between <code>Auto</code>, <code>List</code>, <code>Grid</code> and <code>Card</code>.</p>
    <p>NewPipe explicitly does not support Apple devices, whether iOS, macOS, or anything else. There are already good solutions available for those, such as the app <a href="https://github.com/yattee/yattee">Yattee</a>.</p>
    <p>There are also OS-agnostic solutions available: websites such as <a href="https://invidious.io/">Invidious</a> and <a href="https://piped.video/">Piped</a>, as well as desktop apps like <a href="https://freetubeapp.io/">FreeTube</a>.</p>
    <p>A team member of the <a href="https://gitlab.com/android_translation_layer/android_translation_layer">Android Translation Layer</a> published NewPipe to <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/net.newpipe.NewPipe">Flathub</a>.</p>
