    <p>NewPipe's goal is to as effectively as possible protect its users' privacy.
        This means, the app only sends information to external servers
        which is needed to access content like videos or search results.</p>
    <p>Having said this, the developers of NewPipe hope it is understandable
        that they <strong>will not implement</strong> any form of authentication
        which might allow tracking users.</p>
