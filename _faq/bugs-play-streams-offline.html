    <p>In order to play streams offline, you need to use an external video player.</p>
    <p>The team has considered implementing this directly into NewPipe. This idea was dropped due to the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A phone is usually shipped with an audio and video player.</li>
        <li>There are other <a href="https://search.f-droid.org/?q=video+player">apps</a> available that deal with offline playback, in case the phone doesn't have one.</li>
        <li>One option that could reduce friction between using NewPipe and an external player is <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.brouken.player/">Just Video Player</a>, available on F-Droid, which is also based on ExoPlayer like NewPipe's player.</li>
        <li>NewPipe is not designed to be an all-around video player.</li>
        <li>A huge additional maintenance effort would be required to make this work.</li>
    </ul>
