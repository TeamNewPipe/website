<section>
    <p>Team NewPipe has received several requests to enable posting comments on videos, not just reading them.</p>
    <p>Since NewPipe's goal is to protect its users' privacy, this feature is not implemented.
        This is because an account is required to publish comments on all supported services.
        Logging in with e.g. a Google account would allow the service to track you.
