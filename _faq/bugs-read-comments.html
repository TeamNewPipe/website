<section>
    <p>Team NewPipe have reached several requests to add the possibility to create comments.</p>
    <p>Since NewPipe's goal is to protect its users privacy, this feature is not implemented.
        A login is required to write comments on all supported services.
        Logging in with e.g. a Google account would allow the service to track you.
