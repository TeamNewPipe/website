title: "Read YouTube Comments"
---
<section>
    <p>Team NewPipe have reached several request to view and create comments of YouTube videos.</p>
    <p>Since NewPipe's goal is to protect its users privacy, this feature will be implemented partly.
        A Google login is required to write comments and therefore this part will not be available.<br/>
        However NewPipe's developers have planned to add the ability to read a video's comments.
