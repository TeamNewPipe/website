title: "Use MP3 Files Offline"
---
<section>
    <p class="text-info">MP3 offline usage for audio files is highly requested,
        but brings some difficulties for our developers.</p>
    <p>First, and most importantly, some services like YouTube do not provide MP3 files which could be directly retrieved.
        Therefore, the only thing we could do on NewPipe's side is to convert/transcode M4A or WebM streams.<br/>
        The reason why this features has not been implemented yet, is quite simple:<br/>
        This process requires an external library like FFmpeg which would significantly increase NewPipe's size.
    </p>
    <p>Nevertheless our team is working on a solution to make this features as soon as possible available to you.
        The plan is to move the conversion to an external and thus optional app called
        <a href="https://github.com/brarcher/video-transcoder">Video Transcoder</a> which you can download from
        F-Droid too.
