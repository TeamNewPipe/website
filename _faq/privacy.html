    <p>The following FAQ entry aims to explain NewPipes stance towards privacy in regards to the website and the app. This entry does not replace the privacy policy in its function, which is linked in the footer. NewPipe takes your personal data and the protection of them very serious.</p>
    <p><strong>The website</strong> does not use cookies or any kind of trackers and does not send your data to another party. Stored in access logs of the server is your IP address in an anonymized way (parts of it get deleted) and your user agent, which your browser sends to the server. There is no way NewPipe can identify you through these logs. They are stored in order to obtain a minimum of control against abuses of the webserver, like denial-of-service attacks.<br />If you decide to leave a comment within the website, the server needs to store your full IP address, so NewPipes providers can fulfill legal constraints. All the other data you provide when commenting (the comment + name, optional a link and an e-mail address) will be stored permanently as well. The software NewPipe uses in the back end to provide these comments, <a href="https://posativ.org/isso/">isso</a>, also makes usage of the LocalStorage of your browser in this situation. Unlike cookies, the webserver is not able to access this data. This storage is used by isso to automatically fill out the comment fields from inside your browser.</p>
    <p><strong>The app</strong> does not store or send any data anywhere. Any access to third parties which provide videos/music tries to minimize and anonymize the data send to those providers, only the minimum required to deliver you the media streams will be send. Obviously, the further processing of this data is not covered by NewPipes privacy policy, rather by the ones of the providers of the media you consume.<br />If you activate update notifications in the settings, the app will regularly make a request to NewPipes webserver. This request does not contain any data about you or your device. It is only used to have one endpoint to compare the local and the latest available version.<br />In the unlikely <i>*cough cough*</i> case NewPipe crashes, the app will provide you an error screen. In this screen, you can decide to report the error via an e-mail. If you press this button, your default mail client will be opened and the mail body will contain the error report in a JSON format. This gives you the opportunity to delete any part of the report you do not feel comfortable sending to NewPipe as long as you keep the JSON layout intact. When you send the report, its content as well as your e-mail address will be stored and (automatically) processed by NewPipe hosted servers. Since your E-Mail address is part of this report (and therefore your personal data), you can always request the deletion of those reports from the same E-Mail address, according to the GDPR law NewPipe abides.</p>
    <p>NewPipe hopes this entry provided an easy to understand overview on how we handle your data. In case you have further questions, feel free to contact NewPipe or its helpful community in the ways mentioned in the contact part of the footer.</p>
