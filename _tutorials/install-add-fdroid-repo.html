<section>

    <p><span class="text-info">Team NewPipe's F-Droid repository allows updates for NewPipe to be available faster than on the default F-Droid repository. This is the recommended way of installing NewPipe.</span>

    You will need to add our repository to your F-Droid client. We will only show the steps to add the repo to the official F-Droid app. Please note that it is possible for other clients (such as Neo Store) to have this repository pre-added upon install.

            In case NewPipe is <b>already installed</b> on your device, make sure to <a href="/FAQ/tutorials/import-export-data/#export-database"><b>backup your application data</b></a> and <b>uninstall</b> NewPipe before proceeding.<br>
            After you have followed the instructions below and reinstalled NewPipe from our repository, <a href="/FAQ/tutorials/import-export-data/#import-database"><b>import your backup</b></a>.
