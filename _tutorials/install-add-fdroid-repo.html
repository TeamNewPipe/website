<section>

    <p><span class="text-info">Team NewPipe's F-Droid repository allows for updates to NewPipe to be available faster than on the default F-Droid repository. This is the recommended way of installing NewPipe.</span>

    You will need to add our repository to your F-Droid client. We will only show the steps to add the repo to the official F-Droid app. Please note that it is possible for other clients (such as Neo Store) to have this repository pre-added upon install.

            In case NewPipe is <b>already installed</b> on your device, make sure to <a href="/FAQ/tutorials/import-export-data/#export-database"><b>backup your application data</b></a> and <b>uninstall</b> NewPipe before proceeding.<br>
            After you have followed the instructions below and reinstalled NewPipe from our repository, <a href="/FAQ/tutorials/import-export-data/#import-database"><b>import your backup</b></a>.

            <li>Click <code>OK</code>. The NewPipe upstream repository will be added.</li>
            <li>Even after doing all the previous steps correctly, you'll notice a grey "Unverified" below the repo title. Don't worry. Move to the next step.</li>

            <li>Scroll down to the "Versions" section and tap on it to expand. There could be either one or two entries with the latest version number. One of them is built by F-Droid, and the other one by us. You're looking for the second one.</li>

            Note: If you have the official F-Droid version installed, you won't be able to see (or install) the Newpipe version because it has a different signature. To see it, enable "Include incompatible versions" from F-Droid settings. To install it, first make a database backup of your existing version, uninstall it, then install the new one and restore your backup (<a href="/FAQ/tutorials/import-export-data/#export-database">tutorial</a>).
