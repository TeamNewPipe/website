    and import it on another device.</p>
    <p>To import or export your history, subscriptions and playlists, open the settings
    and go to the <code>Content</code> category. Scroll down and you will see two entries:</p>
    <ul>

        <h3>Export your app data</h3>
    </header>
    <p>To export your app data click on <code>Export database</code>.
        You will now see a dialog where you can select the directory in which NewPipe should store the export file.
        After selecting a directory and confirming it, NewPipe creates a ZIP-file for you.
    </p>
    <p>This file is name like <code>NewPipeData-YearMonthDay_Time.zip</code>.
        This naming allows you to have several backups in one directory.
