# 1. We'd need to escape every single '>' in the changelog
# 2. We cannot use Liquid tags to generate the post URL and therefore would be required to put in an absolute URL

# releaseChangelog  should contain the release highlights of the latest NewPipe release
# releasePostUrl    should contain the URL to the corresponding blog post. If there is no blog post for this release,
