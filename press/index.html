            <h4>About NewPipe</h4>
            <p>NewPipe is an Open Source streaming client for Android. Our goal is to provide a privacy friendly access to existing streaming services like YouTube. The app is designed in such a way that it only transports information necessary for playing the media to external servers and thus protects the privacy of its users.</p>
            <p>A good user experience is important to the developers of NewPipe. Therefore the app offers many solutions for all possible situations. In this way, the resolution and codecs of the video and audio can be set to save data volume in mobile networks. Likewise, NewPipe's video popup and background players make it possible to seamlessly integrate videos and music into daily mobile phone use.</p>
