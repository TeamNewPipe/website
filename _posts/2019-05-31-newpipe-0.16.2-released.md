NewPipe 0.16.2 is a bugfix release which comes along with better readable comments, smaller UX improvements, better translations, bugfixes and more.

##  Comments

After introducing support for reading comments in [version 0.16.1]({% post_url 2019-02-28-newpipe-0.16.0-released %}), [@yausername](https://github.com/yausername) put more effort into the comments UX. In other words, the comment's font size has been enlarged. We hope you are going to enjoy reading comments even more. When scrolling through them, you might recognize that links and video timestamps have been made clickable. On top of that the app can now remember whether you last viewed the comments or the 'next videos' tab and switch to it automatically when opening a video page. 


## Video player and playqueue
[@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) made it possible to share the video with its current timestamp through the main player's dropdown menu. [@nv95](https://github.com/nv95) added a close button to the main player which is shown whenever the playqueue is finished.

By pressing long on the `Background` button in the playlist view, you can now enqueue a whole playlist to the current playqueue. To play a stream directly in background without opening the video page, just tap long on an item in a stream list and choose `Play directly in Background`.


## Further improvements
 
When sharing text with NewPipe which is not an URL, the app automatically shows performs a search using the currently active service. Moreover, this release includes support for opening [invidious](https://invidio.us/) links, a tiny resource clean-up resulting in less code and a smaller APK. We also updated third-party libraries which should bring performance improvements to the video player. As always, the new version comes with bug fixes. [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) fixed a parsing bug which prevented many streams from loading as well as failing YouTube subscription imports. [@Rediron](https://github.com/Redirion) made some improvements to the update checker (only available in the GitHub release) preventing crashes when no internet connection is available.

The English translations for play and enqueue commands were update and more specified by [@epitron](https://github.com/epitron). At this point we would like to thank all the people who contributed to NewPipe in this release by either writing code, participating in discussions, reporting bugs and translating it into various languages! 


## State of the Pipe 2019

By the way: If you haven't seen it yet, we recently published a video in which NewPipe lead maintainer [Christian Schabesberger](https://schabi.org) covers the latest developments of the project, talks about plans for the future and makes a personal statement about his future in the project. You can watch the video [here]({% post_url 2019-05-19-state-of-the-pipe-2019 %}).
