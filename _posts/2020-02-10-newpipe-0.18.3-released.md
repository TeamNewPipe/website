A change on SoundCloud side made it necessary to make some edits to the SoundCloud Extractor, so a new update for NewPipe is here!

<!-- more -->

Since this is a hotfix release, it does not contain any new feature or bugfix, except for the SoundCloud Extractor fixup. If you see any Guru Mediation error in the app, please update to 0.18.3 before you create an issue (you can verify if you actually have `0.18.3+` installed by tapping `About` in the app drawer menu).
SoundCloud changed the API key (called `client_id`), as it uses to do roughly once every 1-2 months. The app's hardcoded client ID was updated by [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr). Further investigation is required to understand why the automatic `client_id` extraction failed after the hardcoded ID became invalid.


## Where to get the latest version

NewPipe notifies you about new versions, you can download them when you press the notification. An alternative is the [Github release page](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases). If you use the [F-Droid app](https://f-droid.org/), it notifies you as well about an update for [NewPipe](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/) - please keep in mind that it can take F-Droid a while to update their repository.

Please let us know what your experience of the latest release is, especially bugs in need of fixing. As usual, you can reach out to us via IRC ([#newpipe on Libera.Chat](ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697/newpipe)), [open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/new) or ideally use our built-in crash reporter to send us machine-readable issue reports, or [send in fixes](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-fixing) yourself.
