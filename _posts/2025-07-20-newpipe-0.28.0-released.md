## Highlights

### Android Auto integration

Thanks to the joint effort of many contributors and a lot of patience, we are happy to announce: NewPipe now integrates nicely with Android Auto! No more boring rides for you - **choose music or podcasts to listen to directly from your car's interface**!

More specifically, the car integration allows you to access and play streams from your **history** and from your local and remote **bookmarked playlists**, search YouTube or any other service you have currently selected in NewPipe, and control the player including the **playing queue**. *Make sure to only use those features when it's safe, to avoid getting distracted.*

The story of this feature begings back in 2022, on 25th of December to be exact. On this day [@haggaie](https://github.com/haggaie) opened a [Pull Request on GitHub promising to add support for Android Auto](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/9592). After multiple rounds of reviews, testing by different people with different cars, finding and fixing bugs, the player was refactored almost completely on our main development branch which made many of the changes incompatible. Even though [@haggaie](https://github.com/haggaie) was left a long time without reviews and feedback, he switly answered and took up the work once our team finally had time to work on his PR. We really let him wait more time than we should have. The team gladly appreciates his patience with us ❤️. After updating the code base, [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) took over the development of the Android Auto integration because he was more familiar with the new player structure and [finished the work](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/12044) begun by [@haggaie](https://github.com/haggaie) in Feburary 2025. The Android Auto integration required complex changes to our internal player code. After even more rounds of reviewing, testing, and bug fixing, the PR was finally merged in March. Thanks to [the nightly builds](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe-nightly) a broad range of users tested the feature on their phones and cars, which led to [more](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/12416) [critical](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/12412) [bugs](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/12410) being fixed before ending up in a release. We want to thank everyone involved in this!

This release is not all about cars and what you can do with them. It comes with more improvements and fixes.

You can add **feed groups** as main screen tabs to directly access your personalized and grouped feeds. This can be done from the `Settings > Content > Content of main page` option by adding a `Channel group page` item. This feature was introduced by [@dev-victoria](https://dev-victoria) who opened their first PR on GitHub and contributed two other fixes to this version as well. Thank you!

In this release the SoundCloud implementation got some love, thanks to the contributors involved! Most notably, [@watermelon42](https://github.com/watermelon42) added support for extracting and displaying content that is liked by an artist or user as a new **"Likes" tab** in the channel page. [@AudricV](https://github.com/AudricV) then added support for **AAC 160k** streams. [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr) removed the now-defunct "Top 50" kiosk, and if you had it among your main page tabs, you will get an alert dialog explaining that it was removed. On a separate note, [we are aware](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/12109) that there are **frequent player crashes** when playing long SoundCloud tracks, and [@davidasunmo](https://github.com/davidasunmo) is already working on a [fix](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/12418), though it couldn't make it into this release.

[@tfga](https://github.com/tfga) added a button to share a local playlist as a **YouTube temporary playlist**. Nice, thanks!

A few improvements were made to make the UI more user-friendly: [@Profpatsch](https://github.com/Profpatsch) added a **hint in the search bar** explaining which service you are currently on, and [@malania02](https://github.com/malania02) added a label to downloaded items that shows their **download date**. Thanks to both!

## Translation and Localization

With this release, X locales received updates and X new locales were added to NewPipe. Those were added to the in-app language chooser (WEREN'T THEY?).
Additionally to the in-app language chooser, you can now use the Android per-app language setting from the system's app info page. This is a feature which was introduced with Android 13 and is now supported by NewPipe [due to neat work](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/12093) by [@mileskrell](https://github.com/mileskrell). NewPipe 0.28.0 replaces the in-app setting of the app localization for Android 13+ devices. The existing in-app preference is automatically migrated to use Android's per-app language setting.

In other localization related news, [@VougJo23](https://github.com/VougJo23) [fixed a visual bug](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/12188) which resulted in RTL usernames of comment authors not being displayed correctly next to LTR timestamps, and [@mileskrell](https://github.com/mileskrell) included the locale country when selecting the audio track for better disambiguation.

## Bug fixes

As usual with every release, we do not only introduce new bugs you can run into, but also fix some. Here is a list of the most notable ones:

- The text in the dark theme is now back to being white, thanks to a workaround around an Android system bug found by [@Thompson3142](https://github.com/Thompson3142)... except that is was already seemingly fixed in 0.27.7? This bug was caused by the WebView used to solve YouTube integrity checks since [0.27.6](https://newpipe.net/blog/pinned/announcement/newpipe-0.27.6-rewrite-team-states/#release-0276), however in 0.27.7 we temporarily switched to a different method to get YouTube data that does not require integrity tokens. In 0.28.0 the bug is now solved for real anyway.
- [@AudricV](https://github.com/AudricV), [@litetex](https://github.com/litetex), [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) and (again) [@AudricV](https://github.com/AudricV) solved four YouTube annoyances caused by recent changes made by the service: playlists not loading more than 100 items, recommendations sometimes not appearing below videos, podcasts not appearing anywhere, and playlists of shorts appearing as empty.
- Did you also get strange UI crashes in the History page, for example when deleting entries? This was a longstanding bug with an unknown cause, until our hero [@j-haldane](https://github.com/j-haldane) ~killed the monster~ fixed it for good!
- [@Isira-Seneviratne](https://github.com/Isira-Seneviratne) fixed the grouping-by-channel of new streams notifications when a video has a different uploader URL than the channel that was fetched. Thanks!
- [@har-123](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/pull/12083) noticed that the three-dot menu items in the channel page were multiplying like rabbits when no one was looking, and fixed their sneaky duplication. Cool!
- [@AndrianaBilali](https://github.com/AndrianaBilali) fixed timestamps not being clickable when viewing the main comment of a comment replies thread. Thanks!

## Wanna Contribute?

If you like the app enough to want to make it even better, or you noticed some glaring error that you can't help but want to fix, you can [read our contribution guidelines](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-fixing) and do a Fix-It Felix.

Or, if you're bilingual (or even multilingual), you could help [translate the app](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/newpipe/).

**Feature additions** to the old codebase have been put on hold for now. We're pretty swamped as it is, and are working to clear our large (and critical) backlog first. Our next priority is to finish the rewrite of the codebase. We are making progress - slowly, but steadily - and you can help out on that too (and learn modern Android development practices along the way).


## Downloads

NewPipe notifies you about new versions. You can download them when you tap the notification, which will take you to the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases).

If you use the [F-Droid app](https://f-droid.org/), it, too, notifies you about updates for [NewPipe](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/).
Please keep in mind that it can take F-Droid a while to update their repository. If you have problems installing the update, you may need to uninstall NewPipe and then install it afresh. (Make sure to back up your data by exporting your database from the `Settings > Backup and restore` menu.)

If you have already installed NewPipe from F-Droid’s repository, to get this version of NewPipe you can do one of the following:

* Wait for them to update
* Switch to NewPipe’s custom repository by following the [directions in the announcement post](https://newpipe.net/blog/announcement/f-droid/pinned/f-droid-repo/)

Note: If you have installed NewPipe from GitHub Releases, you will not have to uninstall it to switch to our custom repo. Just let it update your current version. **Make sure you back up your data as mentioned in the warning at the top of the FAQ page!**
