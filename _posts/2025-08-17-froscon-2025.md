A few TeamNewPipe members attended FrOSCon on 16â€“17 of August 2025, read about our experience here! Also, let us know if you're interested in getting paid for working on NewPipe and its infrastructure.

## Day 0

Did you know that NewPipe's first line of code was written in Ansbach? By coincidence, on our way to FrOSCon, our team members [@fynngodau](https://github.com/fynngodau), [@TheAssassin](https://github.com/TheAssassin) and [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) passed by this town. We rented a car, loaded merch into it and begun our ~ 400km trip to Sankt Augustin. The journey got long and boring due to various traffic jams, but fortunately we could entertain ourselves with (guess what)... NewPipe on Android Auto! Fun fact: we followed our own [setup guide](https://newpipe.net/FAQ/#android-auto) to set it up.

After arriving in the *Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University of Applied Sciences*, we set up our booth and mounted the various marketing material we had prepared: rollups, banners, and even a very professional booth structure. The designs for the marketing materials had been made weeks in advance by [@TheAssassin](https://github.com/TheAssassin) and [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox); we hope you like them! Once everything was mounted and we were satisfied with the placement of the various items (how many computer scientists does it take to center a ~~div~~ banner?), we went to our hotel and had a good night of sleep.

## Day 1

After having breakfast at a local bakery, we delved into the first day of the conference. A lot of NewPipe users came by to express gratitude: thanks for the wholesomeness to everyone who did that! Some other visitors instead did not have NewPipe on their phones (oh no!), but they could try it out on our cool demo devices, which usually convinced them to give NewPipe a shot (except for, well, iPhone owners). We were also able to show off the progress on the refactor and on [NewPlayer](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPlayer) to the keenest users.

The merch we had on our tables was: flyers, stickers, and NewPipe-styled Bierdeckels (i.e. coasters), which we offered to unsuspecting people passing by. Additionally, we had the [NewPipe e.V. statute](https://newpipe-ev.de/assets/documents/statute%20en.pdf) available for reading plus some signup forms in case somebody wanted to [become a member](https://newpipe-ev.de/join.html).

As you might know, we recently released 0.28.0 with support for Android Auto ([blogpost](https://newpipe.net/blog/pinned/announcement/newpipe-0.28.0-released/)), and wanted to show it to our users. Unfortunately the building did not have a big enough entrance to fit the rented car (just joking!), so we had to use [Desktop Head Unit](https://developer.android.com/training/cars/testing/dhu) to emulate Android Auto on a laptop as a demo.

Oh, right, I almost forgot! At some point of the day we adopted a new person to our booth: [@lm41](https://github.com/lm41) joined us to complete [a NewPlayer PR](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPlayer/pull/25) and also occasionally talk with visitors. Thanks for the contributions and for the chats!

In the evening there was a social event for FrOSCon participants on the grounds of the university. It was an occasion to have longer conversations with fellow project maintainers and/or users, and also to have some fun *in a pool of plastic spheres*. [@TheAssassin](https://github.com/TheAssassin) allegedly reported not having done something this silly in a while :-D

## Day 2

On the second day we didn't go to a bakery for breakfast, and instead relied on the free food for exhibitors available in the backstage (which was also there for lunch, later). Thanks a lot to FrOSCon organizers for the catering!

[@Poolitzer](https://github.com/Poolitzer) also joined us on this day, and brought some more Bierdeckels (we almost ran out!) and a few funny jokes. Having more NewPipe personnel meant we could alternatingly take some time off to take a look at the other cool projects at the fair.

The second day went by similarly to the first, except maybe for the fact that more power users seemed to show up, which led to more technical discussions. [@lm41](https://github.com/lm41) joined us again, this time to migrate NewPipe's Gradle scripts from Groovy to Kotlin. Later in the day, he even helped with the teardown. We finished packing up at 17:30, only 30 minutes after the end of the conference, and returned back home quite exhausted (we fortunately did not encounter any traffic jams this time).

Overall, we all enjoyed participating to the conference, showing off NewPipe, making people aware of the existence of NewPipe e.V., and chatting with one another and with visitors from the conference. A deep thank you goes out to the organizers and the helpers of the conference, who made sure everything would go smoothly!

## We are looking for freelancers

After setting up two successful contracts in the past (see [here](https://newpipe-ev.de/posts/2024-06-23_3rd_board_meeting.html) and [here](https://newpipe-ev.de/posts/2024-12-03_hiring_contributor.html)), the last of which is still ongoing, NewPipe e.V. has two more open freelance positions. One is for an Android developer that could bring forward NewPipe's refactor, and the other is for a sysadmin that could maintain the servers. Read all details and apply on [NewPipe e.V.'s website](https://newpipe-ev.de/opportunities.html)!

Paying contributors would not be possible without [your donations](https://newpipe.net/donate/), for which we are very grateful!
