Yes, this is another hotfix release. Can't stop us now. In this version, SoundCloud gets fixed.<!-- more -->

## Why?

Up until this release, NewPipe was using an subdomain to get the data from SoundCloud called `api`. This way of accessing SoundCloud's API was not working consistently anymore for all users, so the developers decided to switch to `api-v2`. While that sounds and is a change under the hood of NewPipe, there are some minor improvements even you as an end user can face.

On top of that, SoundCloud started to change the website's `client_id` more frequently. This ID is required to access the API. We already implemented an algorithm to parse the website's client ID in case our hardcoded one was invalid. However, the validation check turned out to be not that perfect and didn't fail immediately when the streams weren't accessible any more, but only when access to the API was denied completely.

## What changes

You can access SoundCloud without errors now (hopefully). If you are using Playlists, the next entries are loaded a bit faster now. Thumbnails are improved. And finally, tests of the code were improved, so changes to those parts of the code should result in less undiscovered issues during the development process.

These changes were made by the hard-working [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) and [@wb9688](https://github.com/wb9688). [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr) took care of the background process to get these changes in your hands. Thank you three!
