### Make way for the MVP!
Welcome to a brand new release of NewPipe! We fed NewPipe lots of Rare Candies, and after quite a long while, NewPipe learned an awesome new attack: **Bandcamp**! This was added by [@fynngodau](https://github.com/fynngodau), who patiently waited for a year and some months it took us to review, test, forget, double-review, double-test and merge his changes. Please check it out and tell us if you encounter any bugs!

Note: Not everything is working yet (such as fan pages and comments), but the essentials are more or less there. Please open issues on Github for bugs or feature requests, and make sure to follow the template!

Most importantly: enjoy using Bandcamp!

## New

### Bandcamp
We've been quite excited to present this to you. Apart from being a service that provides you high quality music albums (and by high quality we mean lossless!), Bandcamp also has the distinction of keeping all its music DRM-free! This means that you can freely download albums and tracks you buy, and transfer your music wherever you want. You truly own what you buy. This is unlike services like iTunes, which only let you play the music on specific devices using specific players which are approved by a company.

## Improved

- [@B0pol](https://github.com/B0pol) added a setting for the app to follow the device theme. You can also specify if you want your dark theme to be just dark or pitch black.

- [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) (da BAWSE) implemented a SERIOUSLY improved error panel in the app, which is now treated like a new page in your navigation history. This means NO MORE LOSING YOUR ENTIRE BROWSING HISTORY IF YOU ENCOUNTER AN ERROR! Woohoo! So if you are on your 15th video in a series of procrastination impulse watches, and opening the 16th video leads to an error, you can simply... tap back, and you'll go right back to the 15th video. The error report screen you normally encounter immediately upon getting an error is now hidden behind a Report button, which is again treated like just another page in the navigation history. Oh, and there's also a shiny new Retry button. You know, in case whatever you were trying works in the second go. Or 3rd. Or 50th. There's really no upper limit to this. Go crazy.

- Tired of seeing that stupid "Video not available" message that so many videos are prey to, and having no idea why they don't work? Fear not, for [@TiA4f8R](https://github.com/TiA4f8R) is here to save the day! The app now lets you know if the video/audio you're unable to open is georestricted, age-restricted, private, paid, or only available to premium users. This only applies to YouTube and SoundCloud for now, because the other services don't have such restrictions.

- [@mbarashkov](https://github.com/mbarashkov) added the ability to toggle between play/pause with a hardware space button (such as when using scrcpy or a Bluetooth keyboard) if the player is in full screen.

- [@WoodyMats](https://github.com/WoodyMats) added a toast to inform the user that a download has started.

- [@FireMasterK](https://github.com/FireMasterK) changed NewPipe's User Agent to match Tor Browser's. This will help prevent tracking by services.

- [@TiA4f8R](https://github.com/TiA4f8R) added a workaround to enable NewPipe to play HLS tracks on SoundCloud! This essentially means that in addition to the usual 128kbps MP3 stream, you can also choose to play a 64kbps Opus stream! Data-savings-without-any-loss-in-music-quality for the win!

### Fixed 

- [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr) fixed the too-small-thumbnails problem that sometimes cropped up (hehe, geddit? "cropped up") in the video details screen.

- [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr) also fixed the wrong/empty title being shown in the mini player when a series of streams was started in the background player.

- [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr) (clearly the fixer-upper of this version) also fixed the aspect ratio not being stored correctly (Fit/Fill/Zoom). Now this works as users expect it to.

- [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr) (what did we tell you?) fixed the same error as above, but for Youtube Mix playlists.

- [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) fixed the error/infinite loading on the Trending kiosk.

- [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr) also fixed playlist extraction on PeerTube.

## Nerd Talk

- [@Isira-Seneviratne](https://github.com/Isira-Seneviratne) updated the PrettyTime library and adjusted the app code accordingly, also eliminating the need for a workaround in the process.

- The ExoPlayer library was updated from version 2.11.8 to 2.12.3 by [@Redirion](https://github.com/Redirion), along with related app code.

- [@XiangRongLin](https://github.com/XiangRongLin) added the Sonar plugin to the project, which automatically finds and reports mistakes in the code. This will be quite helpful when reviewing PRs, as it will take some burden to check the code for correctness off the developers. You can read more about Sonar [here](https://sonarcloud.io/).

- [@XiangRongLin](https://github.com/XiangRongLin) fixed some more extractor tests for YouTube, SoundCloud and PeerTube.

- [@XiangRongLin](https://github.com/XiangRongLin) also made some tests skippable in certain scenarios where they were not needed to be run.

- [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr) temporarily disabled some tests for media.ccc.de that weren't working.

## Where to get this brand-new version

NewPipe notifies you about new versions. You can download them when you press the notification, which will take you to the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases).

If you use the [F-Droid app](https://f-droid.org/), it, too, notifies you about updates for [NewPipe](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/).
Please keep in mind that it can take F-Droid a while to update their repository. If you have problems installing you may need to uninstall NewPipe and then install it afresh. (Make sure to backup data by exporting your database from the Content settings menu.)

If you already installed NewPipe from F-Droid’s repository, to get this version of NewPipe you can do one of the following:

* Wait for them to update
* Switch to NewPipe’s custom repository by following the [directions in the announcement post](https://newpipe.net/blog/announcement/f-droid/pinned/f-droid-repo/)

Note: If you installed NewPipe from GitHub Releases you will not have to uninstall NewPipe to switch to our custom repo. Just let it update your current version.
Make sure you back up your data as mentioned in the warning at the top of the FAQ page!

Note: If you installed NewPipe from GitHub Releases you will not have to uninstall NewPipe to switch to our custom repo. Just let it update your current version.

Now that you've (hopefully) updated, please let us know what your experience of the latest release is, especially bugs in need of fixing. As usual, you can reach out to us via IRC ([#newpipe on Libera.Chat](https://web.libera.chat/#newpipe)), [open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/new) or, ideally, use our built-in crash reporter to send us machine-readable issue reports. You can even [send in fixes](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-fixing) yourself.

If you have any other questions feel free to post them in the comments here and someone will reply to you.
