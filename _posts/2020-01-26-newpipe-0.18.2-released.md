8 days after the last release and the next one is already out: A hotfix for the Extractor! A change on YouTube's side made it necessary.

## Hotfix

A hotfix release regarding the Extractor usually means that all the older versions of NewPipe are likely to fail to play YouTube videos - this release is no difference. If you see any Guru Mediation error in the app, please update to this version before you create an issue (and/or verify that you actually have `0.18.2+` installed via hitting the `About` section in the left menu).

YouTube changed how they handled json. The actual fix was implemented by [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr), with the help of [@theScrabi](https://github.com/theScrabi) and (arguably even more helping) [@amuc](https://github.com/amuc). It was based on [@dstftw](https://github.com/dstftw)'s implementation in [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl). A big thanks goes to everyone involved.


## Where to get the latest version

NewPipe notifies you about new versions, you can download them when you press the notification. An alternative is the [Github release page](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases). If you use the [F-Droid app](https://f-droid.org/), it notifies you as well about an update for [NewPipe](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/) - please keep in mind that it can take F-Droid a while to update their repository.

Please let us know what your experience of the latest release is, especially bugs in need of fixing. As usual, you can reach out to us via IRC ([#newpipe on Libera.Chat](https://web.libera.chat/#newpipe)), [open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/new) or ideally use our built-in crash reporter to send us machine-readable issue reports, or [send in fixes](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-fixing) yourself.
