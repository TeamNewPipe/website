Do you remember the last releases we titled hotfix? Do you want to know what is different this time? Yes? Come closer, and let me tell you a story about 0.18.5.

## Background

Once upon a time (_August 2017_), YouTube decided to launch a redesign of their website. They applied [Material Design](https://material.io/) and a dark theme. Just with any other website (I am looking at you reddit), the backslash of the community existed, which is probably why Google provided an opt-out. Since NewPipe was written before this design was provided, we continued to opt into using the old one. Everybody was more or less happy and life went on its unstoppable way.

We made a point in totally ignoring the existing of this new interface, mainly because it did not change much unlike its new counterpart. Sadly, the new features Google provided over time landed mostly only on the new material designed page. This is the reason (according to their [official blog post](https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/27596769)) why they decided to stop providing the old one, beginning in March. And this is why the keyboards of our developers were smoking in the last days.

## What changes

Luckily, not much. NewPipe looks as amazing as ever. Two of our lead developers went out of their way and spend each a full half hour of their life to test the app and did not encounter any new bugs. So you should expect this release to be as rock-solid as its predecessors ;) A big thanks goes out to said developers: [TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr) and [wb9688](https://github.com/wb9688). Also thanks to [yausername](https://github.com/yausername) for reporting this in the first place, so we were able to ~~panic~~ react soon enough.

It also means that starting in March, our old versions will stop working. So make sure to update until then!


## Where to get the latest version

NewPipe notifies you about new versions, you can download them when you press the notification. An alternative is the [Github release page](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases). If you use the [F-Droid app](https://f-droid.org/), it notifies you as well about an update for [NewPipe](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/) - please keep in mind that it can take F-Droid a while to update their repository.

Please let us know what your experience of the latest release is, especially bugs in need of fixing. As usual, you can reach out to us via IRC ([#newpipe on Libera.Chat](https://web.libera.chat/#newpipe)), [open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/new/choose) or ideally use our built-in crash reporter to send us machine-readable issue reports. You can even [send in fixes](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-fixing) yourself.
