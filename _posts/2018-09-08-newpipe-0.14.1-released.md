We announce the immediate availability of NewPipe 0.14.1. Everybody is encouraged to update NewPipe because all prior versions do not work anymore. This update is necessary because of changes within YouTube.

**Update: F-Droid released builds of 0.14.1. You can now (and are encouraged to) install NewPipe via F-Droid again.**

As you might know, NewPipe does not use the proprietary YouTube API, but instead parses the website to gain information which is needed to provide you the videos. Yesterday, YouTube rolled out changes to its built-in web player. This caused web scrapers like NewPipe and [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/) to not detect video streams anymore.
Therefore no videos could be played and NewPipe crashed.

Our [privacy respecting crash reporting](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/CrashReportImporter) system received huge amounts of crash reports, and lots of people created new GitHub issues/comments. Big thanks to these who reported this problem and drew our attention on it.

Shortly after YouTube's changes took effect, [@Khang-NT](https://github.com/Khang-NT) provided a fix for youtube-dl which was integrated into [NewPipe Extractor](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor) by [@karyogamy](https://github.com/karyogamy). NewPipe was updated to use the latest version of the extractor, and the release was published.

NewPipe 0.14.1 brings also a fix for long links in video descriptions.


## Get the new version

We recommend you to install the [F-Droid app](https://f-droid.org/) as it notifies you as soon as an update for [NewPipe](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/) is available.

Please let us know about your experience in the latest release, especially bugs that need to be fixed. As usual, you can reach out to us via IRC ([#newpipe on Libera.Chat](ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697/newpipe)), [open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/new) or ideally use our built-in crash reporter to send us machine-readable issue reports.
