This release got delayed by quite a bit, and so it just grew and grew and grew. You're getting a truly massive release to make up for the long wait. Be ready for a whopper of a blog post!

<!-- more -->

Wow. Where do we even start? Let's see... new stream notifications! Now your phone can ping you even more frequently than before! Now you get seamless transition to and from background! Now there is no pause in the audio when switching between apps! YouTube/YouTube Music Mixes, the app suggests you these in the related items so that you can binge curated content to your hearts'... content. And finally, the popup player is usable again on Android 12!

This post also contains all the changes from the 0.22.0 Extractor version, which we were forced to release early as part of the hotfix to fix YouTube playback breaking yet again.

## New

- [@nv95](https://github.com/nv95) brings you a highly requested and anticipated feature: Notifications for new streams from subscribed channels! Now whenever your favourite YouTuber uploads a new video, NewPipe can send you a notification to let you know!


- [@TiA4f8R](https://github.com/TiA4f8R) brings you a second frequently requested and really awesome feature. Seamless switch to and from background! Now when you select "Minimize to background" in settings and minimise the app, NewPipe will pause the video stream and continue the audio stream without interruption! When you switch back to the app, you will see a black screen for a couple of seconds, after which the video will resume playing. (Note: there are certain (usually very old) videos for which this won't work. In those cases, the regular short pause in the audio will occur before playback resumes.)

- [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) made it so that YouTube Mixes and YouTube Music Mixes show up in related videos section. You're no longer forced to do the tedious job of having to share Mix URLs to NewPipe each time from another app to be able to play them! For those who have discovered upon reading this that NewPipe can play Mixes, congrats, and have fun! :)

- [@haklc](https://github.com/haklc) added a cool feature where you can change the audio pitch by semitones instead of percentage! This is a nifty tool for musically-inclined users, and also something fun to play with for everyone else. Don't worry, you can toggle a checkbox to revert to the percentage way of doing things.

- [@ktprograms](https://github.com/ktprograms) added a button to the queue menu in the main player which lets you add the current queue to a new or an existing playlist. Incidentally, this can also be used to 'convert' a remote playlist into a local NewPipe playlist, which you can then edit away to your heart's content. Isn't that such a nifty feature?

### Improved

- [@XiangRongLin](https://github.com/XiangRongLin) made the throttling decryption code more resistant to API changes on YouTube's end. This means that there is now a lesser chance of videos slowing down to glacial, virtually unplayable, speeds in the future. Woohoo!

- [@TiA4f8R](https://github.com/TiA4f8R) added some more parameters to the requests the Extractor sends to YouTube, which make them mimic official clients more closely, yielding some benefits like reduced probability of throttling as well as reduced data use.

- [@TiA4f8R](https://github.com/TiA4f8R) also made it so that separate video and audio streams are fetched for livestreams, instead of combined streams. And and and! You can now rewind livestreams back more than 30 seconds! How much you can rewind depends on the livestream in question. It's not a fixed value. Also, please note that rewinding in livestreams can be disabled by individual creators on YouTube.

- [@ktprograms](https://github.com/ktprograms) made the player remember the step size for the speed and pitch adjustment bars in the playback control dialog. Now the dialog doesn't default to the 25% step size each time you open it. Rather, it shows you the last used step size.

- [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) ensured that all the relevant dialogs in the app uniformly show the "OK" and "Cancel" buttons, which are the default on Android, instead of "Yes" and "No" buttons.

- [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) also improved the player UI and navigability for Android TV. This fixed several problems: unreachable buttons in the main player queue, incorrect background theming of the main player menus, and the player controls intermittently showing up below the queue menu. 

- [@SpinHit](https://github.com/SpinHit) added a confirmation dialog when deleting all files in the Download menu.

- [@mauriciocolli](https://github.com/mauriciocolli) noticed that the app used duplicated icons for the night theme, which caused visibility problems for a lot of them. Since the original icons are vector drawables, the duplicated icons were deleted en masse, and instead, color attributes were used to match the original icons to the active theme.

- In a surprise entry, [@karyogamy](https://github.com/karyogamy), a former contributor, showed up out of the blue and did some major refactoring work on the player code, which was blocking further ExoPlayer updates! As a followup, ExoPlayer has now been updated from version 2.14.2 to version 2.17.1, the latest release, skipping _two_ major releases. The code was also simplified a lot, and some custom code was dropped in favour of using ExoPlayer's functionality directly.

- [@karyogamy](https://github.com/karyogamy) also added an experimental setting to Video and Audio settings called "Playback Load Interval Size". This setting is meant for users to experiment and see if changing it to something other than the default ExoPlayer value helps reduce the long buffer time (despite fast internet speed) before video playback starts for YouTube videos. NOTE: This is only meant for initial video playback, which is when a video is opened for the first time. It does not apply to reopened videos, or to the buffering that occurs when jumping to another timestamp within a video. For those who are interested in investigating and finding out the best value, you're welcome to leave a comment on the PR with your findings.

### Fixed

- To start this list off, a very critical fix! Users on Android 12 had been unable to use the popup player (Picture-in-Picture) for most of a year, because it prevented interaction with the screen outside of the player. We spent a very long time investigating this, to no avail. It was [@moneytoo](https://github.com/moneytoo), the developer of Just Video Player, who recently figured out that the problem was caused by the popup player's close button. Shortly after that, it was our very own [@TiA4f8R](https://github.com/TiA4f8R) who realised that this longstanding bug was easily solved by reducing the opacity of the close button below a threshold value (which was essentially a single line of change to the code!). Phew! Rejoice, Android 12 users! The power of the popup is in your palms again!

- [@TiA4f8R](https://github.com/TiA4f8R) fixed the extraction of videos from certain kinds of YouTube series playlists, and also fixed the playlist _view_ count for learning playlists being mistakenly shown as the playlist _stream_ count.

- [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) fixed the extraction of YouTube Music Mixes, which was broken in certain countries.

- [@litetex](https://github.com/litetex) fixed the extraction of YouTube Shorts, which don't show the duration any longer after YouTube made a server-side change. Now the large number of "Not loaded" channels when refreshing the feed, as well as the annoyingly frequent error snackbar, won't bother you anymore.

- [@TiA4f8R](https://github.com/TiA4f8R) fixed the extraction of embeddable age-restricted videos on YouTube, as well as videos that provide a content warning and require user consent before playback. Keep in mind that YouTube can break the extraction of age-restricted videos again at any time, so enjoy it while it lasts.

- As a follow-up, [@TiA4f8R](https://github.com/TiA4f8R) also ensured that subtitles are extracted for age-restricted videos.

- The infamous 'n' parameter used by YouTube changed again, which caused throttling. That was fixed (again) by [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox).

- If you used external buttons (like on a Bluetooth headphone or speaker) to resume playback, the player controls UI would remain on screen forever, instead of fading out after a few moments. [@ktprograms](https://github.com/ktprograms) fixed this.

- The update check would randomly fail while the app was in the background. [@TacoTheDank](https://github.com/TacoTheDank) updated some deprecated code to fix this.

- The new error notifications added by [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) in a previous release crashed the app on KitKat, which they have now fixed.

- [@karyogamy](https://github.com/karyogamy) also fixed playback being reset to the beginning when the player type was changed (e.g. popup -> audio or audio -> main).

- [@mauriciocolli](https://github.com/mauriciocolli) fixed the layout of the video resolution selection menu in the download dialogue, which earlier left space for a non-existent mute icon to the left of each option.

- If you tried to rotate the screen while the "Add to playlist" dialogue was open, the app would crash, which has been fixed by [@GGAutomaton](https://github.com/GGAutomaton). Thanks!

## Nerd Talk

- dependabot updates:
  - Bump actions/checkout from v2 to v3
  - Bump spotbugs-annotations from 4.5.3 to 4.6.0
  - Bump gson from 2.8.9 to 2.9.0
  - Bump actions/cache from 2 to 3
  - Bump rhino from 1.7.13 to 1.7.14

- [@litetex](https://github.com/litetex) refactored the `YoutubeCommentsExtractor` class to use the Java 8 Stream API, which greatly simplifies the code and reduces potential bugs.

- [@FireMasterK](https://github.com/FireMasterK) added support for extracting the channel subscriber count in the `StreamInfo` class.

- [@FireMasterK](https://github.com/FireMasterK) fixed a PeerTube test, and also removed the need for a new `CommentsInfo` instance each time one of the methods of this class had to be called, reducing the RAM burden caused by the unneeded instances.

- [@litetex](https://github.com/litetex) realised that our hardcoded SoundCloud ClientID was quickly after each release out of date, so there was no point in updating it again and again. It has been removed completely. Now we don't have to chase after a moving goalpost of an optimisation, which hardly benefited users. Thanks, litetex!

- [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) added the `MockOnly` JUnit 5 extension to all the YouTube extraction tests so that they work for Mixes. Moreover, the `DownloaderFactory` class's methods were made static, shaving off a little bit of CPU overhead each time that code is run.

- [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) added the Checkstyle static code analysis tool to the NewPipe Extractor project, so that code formatting remains standardised throughout the repo. A bunch of code was also refactored along the way. (The Checkstyle mentioned in previous blog posts is part of the NewPipe repo.)

- [@TacoTheDank](https://github.com/TacoTheDank) replaced the `CircleImageView` library with Google's own Material library, `ShapeableImageView`. Taco dares you to find the difference between the old and new icons. (Hint for those who really want to try: look at circular image icons, like the channel avatars.) Aaanyway, that's one less dependency! Less code is good code.

- [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) made a lot of complicated changes that we don't understand at all so that there is no raw use of parameterized classes in the code, which generates a Java warning. We're assuming this is a good thing. Let us know in the comments.

- [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) fixed another build warning, this time by AndroidX, about database queries returning unused columns. For this, AndroidX's `RewriteQueriesToDropUnusedColumns` function was used.

- [@Atemu](https://github.com/Atemu) fixed the app failing to build on Macbooks with Apple's in-house (M1, etc.) chips by updating the AndroidX Room version.

- [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr) refactored the way `InfoItemDialog`s are generated, as the previous code was not up to par in terms of legibility, structure, consistency, code duplication, and separation of concerns.

- [@avently](https://github.com/avently) implemented a better equality check for queues, which ensures that going up the backstack via the Back button won't result in duplicates.

- [@TacoTheDank](https://github.com/TacoTheDank), in their LibraryMan avatar:
  - Gradle (and wrapper): 7.3.3 -> 7.4.2
  - Android Gradle Plugin: 7.0.4 -> 7.1.3
  - buildTools: 30.0.3 -> 31.0.0
  - Kotlin: 1.5.31 -> 1.6.20
  - ktlint: 0.43.2 -> 0.44.0
  - Checkstyle: 9.2.1 -> 9.3
  - Google Material: 1.4.0 -> 1.5.0 (which allowed one method to be updated to a much simpler version)
  - AndroidX:
    - LocalBroadcastManager: 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0
    - Media: 1.4.3 -> 1.5.0
    - Preference: 1.1.1 -> 1.2.0
    - ConstraintLayout: 2.1.2 -> 2.1.3
    - Room: 2.4.1 -> 2.4.2
  - GitHub Actions dependencies:
    - github-script: v5 -> v6
    - and all the rest: v2 -> v3

- While investigating some player UI layout issues, [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) realised that the `large-land` XML layout file wasn't actually being used at all, and removed it, getting rid of some 800 lines of duplicated code!

- [@TacoTheDank](https://github.com/TacoTheDank) migrated the app update checker from using the deprecated `IntentService` service to using a worker, by adding the AndroidX `Work` library. There was also some Kotlin-isation and refactoring involved.

- [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) de-duplicated a couple of functions that were both meant to fetch the full stream info if only sparse info was fetched earlier, improved the toast shown for this action, and ensured that streams are properly saved in the database, negating any potential side effects of incorrectly stored info.

- [@XiangRongLin](https://github.com/XiangRongLin) took some steps towards refactoring the `Player` class by extracting some view click listeners out of it, and into their own classes.

- [@TacoTheDank](https://github.com/TacoTheDank) found 3 unused classes, containing about 400 lines of code in all, and removed them like a BAWSE.

- [@TacoTheDank](https://github.com/TacoTheDank) made some improvements to the About page, which had earlier been converted to Kotlin, by grouping some code and de-duplicating some other code.

- [@TacoTheDank](https://github.com/TacoTheDank) created a stub implementation of a Listener so that its unused methods could be removed from a couple of classes, and replaced a plain old Java listener with an AndroidX Kotlin Listener extension.

- [@TacoTheDank](https://github.com/TacoTheDank) did some lint cleanup of the code by fixing some parameters, removing unused ones, and other miscellaneous fixes.

- [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) further updated Checkstyle to version 10.0, and placed all its files inside a `checkstyle` subfolder. This fixed many build warnings, and possibly reduced build times. An unused configuration, and some outdated warning suppressions, were also removed.

- [@litetex](https://github.com/litetex) updated the app's GPLv3 license text to the latest version from the GNU website, and deleted the `copyright` file, which finally allowed GitHub to recognise the app license correctly.

- Since Checkstyle files were moved into their own subfolder, [@Trust04zh](https://github.com/Trust04zh) updated the CONTRIBUTING guidelines to reflect this change.

- [@TacoTheDank](https://github.com/TacoTheDank) replaced an unofficial checklist icon with the official Google one, and improved formatting in some XML layout and icon files.
