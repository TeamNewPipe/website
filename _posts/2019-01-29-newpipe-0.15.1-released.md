After having had to publish 0.15.0 [a bit earlier than we wanted to]({% post_url 2019-01-18-newpipe-0.15.0-released %}) due to YouTube breaking their site again, we're happy to announce the release of the bugfix release 0.15.1.

## Update notification
[@krtkush](https://github.com/krtkush) implemented an important part of making NewPipe more bug hardened. He implemented notifications for app updates which inform users of the GitHub build about new versions available on GitHub.

[@theScrabi](https://github.com/theScrabi) had interesting conversation with F-Droid contributors about speeding up the APK build process on 35C3 back in December. As a result of this, [@TheAssassin](https://github.com/theAssasin) is working on setting up our own F-Droid repository. In a further step, we want to set up [reproducible builds](https://f-droid.org/docs/Reproducible_Builds/) in our F-Droid builds process. This will resolve the problem that a NewPipe version which has been downloaded from F-Droid cannot be updated with a new build from GitHub.

These two steps aim to make NewPipe more flexible and faster in deploying critical bug fixes.


## Further improvements
The download process which received a big upgrade in NewPipe 0.15.0, got a bunch of smaller improvements in this release, too. These are mostly bugfixes, e.g. the video and audio stream should be synchronous again. Unfortunately, this doubles the space which is required for merging the video and audio streams. For example when a video stream with 500MiB and an audio stream with 25MiB are downloaded another 525MiB are required while merging both streams into one file.

[@yausername](https://github.com/yausername) fixed an extraction bug which made livestreams stop after a few seconds.


## Get the new version

We recommend you to install the [F-Droid app](https://f-droid.org/) as it notifies you as soon as an update for [NewPipe](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/) is available.

Please let us know what your experience of the latest release is, especially bugs in need of fixing. As usual, you can reach out to us via IRC ([#newpipe on Libera.Chat](https://web.libera.chat/#newpipe)), [open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/new) or ideally use our built-in crash reporter to send us machine-readable issue reports, or [send in fixes](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-fixing) yourself.
