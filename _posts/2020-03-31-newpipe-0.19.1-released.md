Argh. We wanted to make the last release perfect. This worked out well - almost.

In this release a rare database migration issue was fixed.

<!-- more -->

With NewPipe 0.19.0 [@mauriciocolli](https://github.com/mauriciocolli) introduced grouped channels and multiple feeds. This needed some major changes to the app database.

Shortly after NewPipe 0.19.0 was released, we got a report telling us that NewPipe refused to start. It turned out that under rare circumstances, the database contained `null` values which we didn't handle properly when updating the database structure which was used before 0.19.0. [@mauriciocolli](https://github.com/mauriciocolli) and [@XiangRongLin](https://github.com/XiangRongLin) took action quickly, found the cause of the crash and fixed it.

## Where to get the latest version

NewPipe notifies you about new versions, you can download them when you press the notification. An alternative is the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases). If you use the [F-Droid app](https://f-droid.org/), it notifies you as well about an update for [NewPipe](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/) - please keep in mind that it can take F-Droid a while to update their repository.

Please let us know what your experience of the latest release is, especially bugs in need of fixing. As usual, you can reach out to us via IRC ([#newpipe on Libera.Chat](https://web.libera.chat/#newpipe)), [open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/new/choose) or ideally use our built-in crash reporter to send us machine-readable issue reports. You can even [send in fixes](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-fixing) yourself.
