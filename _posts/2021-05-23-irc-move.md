We wrote more words below, but if you do not need/care about this or already know what that is about, for you in a few words: NewPipe has an active [IRC channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) where developers and users chat and can ask questions. This channel moved from the freenode to the brand new **Libera.Chat** network. ~~Until Matrix finalizes its bridge to the new network, the room on freenode will be kept alive, but as soon as that happens, it will be closed officially.~~ We no longer provide a channel on freenode and urge you to leave this network sooner than later.

## Short notice

Hi. You clicked on this blog post, probably expecting our usual in-depth explanation of the current situation whilst providing elaborate technical background so you can understand everything. However, we only want to link to a separate article like we did with the [youtube-dl DMCA strike](https://newpipe.net/blog/announcement/youtube-dl-dmca-analysis/). [This one](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/freenode-irc-has-been-taken-over-by-the-crown-prince-of-korea/) written on *Ars Technica* provides a good overview in our opinion. If you want to know more about this, we urge you to use the search engine of your choice. What we can tell you however is what you have to do with your IRC client to join our channel `#newpipe`. A comprehensive connection guide can be found on [Libera.Chat's homepage](https://libera.chat/guides/connect).

Initially, we wanted to keep the channel open on freenode to ease the transition to the new network. However, last night we found it was forcefully closed by the "new management". The reason, you ask? It mentioned our move to Libera.Chat, and this was labeled "spam" and "off-topic". People who join anew are now redirected to `##newpipe`, which is neither in our moderation nor an official NewPipe channel. This happened to [hundreds of channels](https://www.devever.net/~hl/freenode_abuse2), apparently.

Our heartfelt sorry to all matrix users who won't be able to communicate with us for now. Good news: the bridge will be up shortly, in a few days, according to the providers.

If you clicked on this blog post expecting a new NewPipe version, don't worry, we will link to it right here once it is released. This will happen very soon (TM). It is going to be a very relaxed release, nothing stressing one out. Just the perfect thing after this exhausting move of IRC networks.
