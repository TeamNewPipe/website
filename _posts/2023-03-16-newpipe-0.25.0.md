Well well well. Look at us getting a new release out. We have not really done this in a while, have we? Let's see if we've still got it.

<!-- more -->

\*one month later*

Damn it, we certainly didn't have it in us to get this blog post out in time. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/opusforlife2">@Opusforlife</a>, it did materialize after all, instead of ending up in blog post purgatory.

But for now, first blog post of 2023, so we get to say happy new year! We hope it will be at least as good as 2022 to you, if not better. We certainly tried making NewPipe better with this release. Read on to find out more about all the changes which made it into this version.

Oh, and some of you will have noticed this already: the player notification lost some action buttons on Android 13. This is a known problem. We just need to update our code to match what A13 is expecting of us. It will be taken care of, don't you worry.

### New

- [@FireMasterK](https://github.com/FireMasterK) started work on adding Extractor support for fetching audio track information! This is intended for videos which have multiple audio tracks, such as different languages. Eventually, the Extractor will expose this info so that clients can make use of it. Just a heads up for all the people freaking out about Arabic Mr Beast. There is progress. Breathe.

- [@FireMasterK](https://github.com/FireMasterK) also changed how YouTube comments are parsed, to make the timestamps and URLs tappable! Moreover, the Extractor now also provides the total comment count for clients to show.

- [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr) added Extractor support for comment replies on PeerTube! 

- [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr) also added support for searching for playlists and channels on PeerTube!

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/screenshots/peertube_filter.png" class="img-responsive">
    <figcaption class="text-center">We see you searching for "Best 1863 songs of all times".</figcaption>
</figure>


- [@Isira-Seneviratne](https://github.com/Isira-Seneviratne) added a toast for when no app update is found after a manual check is performed.

- [@Theta-Dev](https://github.com/Theta-Dev) added the subscriber count below the channel name on the video details page. Even more details! All the details! 

- [@Jared234](https://github.com/Jared234) added the Download option to the long-press menu of queue items.
<div class="media-row media-items-2">
<img class="no-flow img-responsive notification-align-center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/screenshots/download_before.png"/>
<img class="no-flow vertical" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/screenshots/download_after.png"/>
</div>
<div class="text-center"><i>There were two phones needed to make this screenshot, definetly not someone being unable to do CSS.</i></div>

- [@Jared234](https://github.com/Jared234) also made it so that manually setting a local playlist's thumbnail makes it permanent. As a consequence, the playlist long-press menu has been reworked to add a new option to unset the thumbnail. (If you're wondering where to find the option to set a thumbnail in the first place, it's by long-pressing on a playlist video.) 

- [@AudricV](https://github.com/AudricV) added a long-press action to hashtags and URLs in the video description, which copies them to the clipboard.

- [@mahendranv](https://github.com/mahendranv) added a new card view for videos in lists! You can check it out in Appearance settings. Beware that the thumbnails will look blurry, as support for extracting HD thumbnails is still on the way.

<img class="no-flow vertical" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/screenshots/cards.png"/>
<div class="text-center"><i>I wonder if these cards are tradeable.</i></div>

### Improved

- [@FireMasterK](https://github.com/FireMasterK) implemented extracting Bold, Italic, and Strikethrough formatting for YouTube text. NoW *vIdEO tiTLeS* ~~lige~~ like thIS **wILl loOk** eVEn bETtEr!!!111 

- [@AudricV](https://github.com/AudricV) added support for showing the duration for video premieres (upcoming videos). Moreover, the upload date and view count is now shown for playlist items.

<figure class="center">
    <img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/screenshots/premiere_before.png"/>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/screenshots/premiere_after.png"/>
    <figcaption class="text-center">Sonic will rage for 1 1/2 hours.</figcaption>
</figure>

- [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr) added support for extracting a channel's URL and verification status in SoundCloud playlists. They were already available for YouTube playlists.

- [@AudricV](https://github.com/AudricV) added support for the new "live" URLs on YouTube (of the form `https://www.youtube.com/live/LIVE_ID`), so the app doesn't reject these URLs as unsupported anymore. We pride ourselves on being inclusive of everything, including links of all kinds.

- [@dhruvpatidar359](https://github.com/dhruvpatidar359) removed the redundant/overlapping toast shown on Android 13+ when copying to the clipboard. Android 13 has added its own cool mini-clipboard box thingy that shows for a while in the corner upon copying something, so the toast wasn't needed anymore.

<figure class="center">
    <img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/screenshots/copy_before.png"/>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/screenshots/copy_after.png"/>
    <figcaption class="text-center">Yes we are totally up to date with the Android versions!</figcaption>
</figure>

- [@shivambeohar](https://github.com/shivambeohar) removed some empty space to the right of the bottom-player close button, thus making it larger and much easier to tap.

- [@Isira-Seneviratne](https://github.com/Isira-Seneviratne) improved the resolution of player notification thumbnails by using smoother bitmap downscaling, which made the resulting image way better!

<figure class="center">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/screenshots/thumbnail_scaling.jpg" class="img-responsive"/>
    <figcaption class="text-center">You can't count the pixels anymore, even though you try!</figcaption>
</figure>

- [@pratyaksh1610](https://github.com/pratyaksh1610) renamed the "Help" button to "Fast mode" in the "What's New" tab's menu, to make it self explanatory.

- [@Poslovitch](https://github.com/Poslovitch) (with inputs from [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox)) added a text hint to improve discoverability of the subscription import function for new users. It shows up whenever the user has zero subscriptions.

- When the user sets the theme to something other than Auto, it causes the Night theme sub-setting to disappear. [@Jared234](https://github.com/Jared234) changed it to become greyed out and disabled instead, to improve discoverability.

- [@Jared234](https://github.com/Jared234) also changed the player's seeking behaviour so that it no longer pauses the stream being played while the user is seeking.

- [@pratyaksh1610](https://github.com/pratyaksh1610) added an icon for the "Play All" button in channels and playlists.

<img class="no-flow vertical" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/screenshots/play_all_icon.png"/>
<div class="text-center"><i>You get an icon, you get an icon, everyone gets an icon.</i></div>

- [@pratyaksh1610](https://github.com/pratyaksh1610) also added a language suffix to downloaded subtitle filenames. For those people who download subtitles in multiple languages for some reason, you're welcome.

- [@Redirion](https://github.com/Redirion) made the Samsung DeX availability check run only on Samsung devices, because it's pointless to run it on your Super-pHone Ultpro MinMax Pikachu Edition.

- [@Marius1501](https://github.com/Marius1501) made "What's New" a default tab on the main page. This will help users discover a core functionality of NewPipe, which is new stream feeds and updates. So far, users have had to stumble upon it themselves by delving deep into the app settings. They also changed the tab's icon to better reflect its function, and prevent confusion with RSS feeds.

<img class="no-flow vertical" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/screenshots/whats_new_tab.png"/>
<div class="text-center"><i>What's new? That's new! 4 tabs by default.</i></div>

- [@Marius1501](https://github.com/Marius1501) also made several improvements to channel items in grid lists. The thumbnails have been increased to a sensible size. A truncated channel description is shown, as well as the subscriber count. The description can be 2 or 3 lines high, depending on its size.

- Finally, [@Marius1501](https://github.com/Marius1501) also changed the YouTube Chapters icon in the player from a numbered list (which looked very similar to the queue icon, a bulleted list) to an open book.

<figure class="center">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/screenshots/new_yt_chapters_icon.png" class="img-responsive">
    <figcaption class="text-center">We are an open book. That joke wrote itself.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Fixed

- [@Theta-Dev](https://github.com/Theta-Dev) fixed the extraction of subscriber and video counts in search results for YouTube channels which have handles.

- [@lonewolf2208](https://github.com/lonewolf2208) removed a redundant check for YouTube videos which prevented showing their view count in lists.

- [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr) fixed the error shown when search results contain YouTube channels that don't have any subscribers yet.

- [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) fixed opening YouTube Music Mix URLs in the app. Earlier, YouTube treated a Music Mix as just a special kind of YouTube playlist. Now it is treated like a YouTube Mix instead, so the code parsing it had to be changed accordingly.

- [@AudricV](https://github.com/AudricV) fixed the YouTube channel ID extraction needed for the RSS feed button in channels, which was broken for users in some regions.

- [@AudricV](https://github.com/AudricV) also fixed the extraction of Likes on SoundCloud.

- [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr) fixed extracting YouTube comments which contain a hashtag, which were throwing an error previously.

- [@han-sz](https://github.com/han-sz) fixed the persistent translucent overlay on the player when in desktop/DeX mode, or using a mouse/non-touch input.

<figure class="center">
    <img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/screenshots/dex_before.jpg"/>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/screenshots/dex_after.jpg"/>
    <figcaption class="text-center">If you want that effect now, you can put paper in front of your TV.</figcaption>
</figure>

- [@Douile](https://github.com/Douile) made the `Enqueue next` option show only when in the middle of a queue, not at the end, where it had the same effect as `Enqueue` and was hence redundant.

- [@dngray](https://github.com/dngray) removed the dead Privacy Tools PeerTube instance from the manifest. Unlike URLs of private YouTube front-ends, where only the relevant sub-string is parsed, the app will try to open the actual PeerTube instance behind that URL, which is a dead end in this case.

- [@pratyaksh1610](https://github.com/pratyaksh1610) fixed a crash that occurred upon tapping `Add to playlist` from the 3-dot menu while the playlist was still loading. Since the Share button is non-functional until the playlist has loaded, a toast was added to inform the user.

- [@evermind-zz](https://github.com/evermind-zz) enabled using the background player even when there are no separate audio streams! This was achieved by using the video stream as the source for audio. Keep in mind that the entire video stream will still be played, so you will not be saving any data by doing this. For videos with separate audio streams (which means most of them), they will continue to play just the audio part as before. PeerTube was the service most impacted by this limitation, so those users can rejoice.

<img class="no-flow vertical" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/screenshots/peertube_bg.png"/>
<div class="text-center"><i>Who even needs visuals?</i></div>

- [@devlearner](https://github.com/devlearner) improved the `Open` action dialogue, so that it can survive screen rotations. They also added the `Fetching stream info` toast before the `Download` dialogue, just like the other ones. A bug on older Android versions was also worked around, where the `Open` dialogue wouldn't appear on the first try after a cold app start.

- [@devlearner](https://github.com/devlearner) also fixed a bug which caused touch events to be blocked while stream info was loading for the `Download` or `Add to playlist` dialogues.
 
- [@petlyh](https://github.com/petlyh) ensured that the app asks for the `Draw over other apps` permission when enqueuing a video in the popup player while the queue is currently empty, instead of just crashing.

- [@Jared234](https://github.com/Jared234) fixed a bug where using the option to `Remove watched videos` from a playlist also removed the currently playing video from the queue. This also fixed a bug with the same underlying cause, where deleting videos from a playlist and then using the `Remove` option caused the deleted videos to reappear.

- [@Jared234](https://github.com/Jared234) also fixed a bug preventing the display of multiple empty playlists in the `Bookmarked playlists` tab.

- Clearly on a roll, [@Jared234](https://github.com/Jared234) also fixed a bug where playing a playlist/channel in the background, and then trying to play another stream from the same playlist/channel, caused the player to stop.

- After [@FireMasterK](https://github.com/FireMasterK) improved the underlying code, [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) prevented ellipsised links in comments from being tapped, to not allow garbage URLs to be opened. Previously, too many characters were being truncated while ellipsising, which has now been limited to the last 2 characters.

### Localisation

- [@GET100PERCENT](https://github.com/GET100PERCENT) added Odia to the app's language selector.

### Nerd Talk

- dependabot updated: gson, junit-bom, and jsoup.

- [@Isira-Seneviratne](https://github.com/Isira-Seneviratne) improved the code in `YoutubeParsingHelper`, and bumped the required Java version to 11 in the Extractor. This also allowed using some functions introduced in Java 11.

- [@Isira-Seneviratne](https://github.com/Isira-Seneviratne) replaced custom UTF-8 usage in URL builders throughout the Extractor codebase with StandardCharsets.UTF_8. The app code was modified accordingly.

- [@FireMasterK](https://github.com/FireMasterK) noticed that Jitpack gradle builds were still defaulting to Java 8, so ensured that they use Java 11 from now on, the minimum required version as mentioned above.

- [@lrusso96](https://github.com/lrusso96) simplified and optimised the code for duration parsing of YouTube videos.

- [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr) fixed the extraction of detailed error messages for certain unavailable streams on YouTube.

- [@FireMasterK](https://github.com/FireMasterK) updated `checkstyle` from 9.3 to 10.4, an upgrade that was blocked on making Java 11 the minimum required version, and also removed an unused dependency.

- [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) blocked the wrong nullable/nonnull imports from being used, via checkstyle rules. Now Android-specific ones are used for the app, and Java ones for the Extractor. Earlier, both codebases used a mixture of both, which had to be cleaned up frequently.

- [@Isira-Seneviratne](https://github.com/Isira-Seneviratne) added the `Locale.forLanguageTag()` function to the app, which was blocked on the minAPI being bumped to 21. Since the Extractor still caters to apps with lower minAPIs, the compat version of the function was used there for backwards compatibility.

- [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr) ensured that the app reports exceptions thrown while getting a PeerTube stream's subtitles.

- [@Isira-Seneviratne](https://github.com/Isira-Seneviratne) used immutable `Map` methods in multiple places in the extractor, simplifying a lot of the code.

- [@Isira-Seneviratne](https://github.com/Isira-Seneviratne) made `PendingIntents` immutable on Android 6.0 and later, to fix compatibility issues with Android 12+.

- [@goyalyashpal](https://github.com/goyalyashpal) changed the image-minimizer bot in our repo to specify image width instead of height, which fixes appearance in multiple display sizes and dimensions.

- [@TacoTheDank](https://github.com/TacoTheDank) updated the Sonarqube, ACRA, Android Gradle Plugin, and Desugaring libraries. [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr) and [@Isira-Seneviratne](https://github.com/Isira-Seneviratne) later updated the latter two.

- [@Isira-Seneviratne](https://github.com/Isira-Seneviratne) replaced some bare math operations with a safer, dedicated function.

- [@Isira-Seneviratne](https://github.com/Isira-Seneviratne) used `SparseArrayCompat` instead of the regular version to avoid [integer boxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_(computer_science)#Boxing), which reduces RAM usage for thumbnail previews, searches, and downloads.

- [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) set the compileSdk and targetSdk to 33 (Android 13), and updated LeakCanary from 2.5 to 2.9.1. Several code changes accompanied this SDK version bump.

- [@Isira-Seneviratne](https://github.com/Isira-Seneviratne) refactored `VideoDetailFragment` and `VideoPlayerUi` to use lambdas, hence simplifying the code.

- [@Isira-Seneviratne](https://github.com/Isira-Seneviratne) updated RxJava and RxAndroid, which should reduce power consumption on mobile devices! You must spend all that extra battery juice on watching more videos, obviously.

- [@Isira-Seneviratne](https://github.com/Isira-Seneviratne) simplified some code in `NotificationModeConfigAdapter` by using `ListAdapter`.

- [@Isira-Seneviratne](https://github.com/Isira-Seneviratne) cleaned up `Optional`-related code by removing a method no longer needed, and via using `Optional` method chaining.

- [@Isira-Seneviratne](https://github.com/Isira-Seneviratne) removed `Runnable` variables from the double-tap and download handlers, and replaced them with lambdas.

- [@Isira-Seneviratne](https://github.com/Isira-Seneviratne) used `WindowCompat` instead of the regular library to replace deprecated UI visibility flags.

- [@obfusk](https://github.com/obfusk) provided a critical workaround needed to re-enable reproducible builds for NewPipe.

### Where to get this brand-new version

NewPipe notifies you about new versions. You can download them when you press the notification, which will take you to the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases).

If you use the [F-Droid app](https://f-droid.org/), it, too, notifies you about updates for [NewPipe](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/).
Please keep in mind that it can take F-Droid a while to update their repository. If you have problems installing the update, you may need to uninstall NewPipe and then install it afresh. (Make sure to backup data by exporting your database from the `Settings > Content` menu.)

If you already installed NewPipe from F-Droid’s repository, to get this version of NewPipe you can do one of the following:

* Wait for them to update
* Switch to NewPipe’s custom repository by following the [directions in the announcement post](https://newpipe.net/blog/announcement/f-droid/pinned/f-droid-repo/)

Note: If you installed NewPipe from GitHub Releases you will not have to uninstall NewPipe to switch to our custom repo. Just let it update your current version.
Make sure you back up your data as mentioned in the warning at the top of the FAQ page!

Now that you've (hopefully) updated, please let us know what your experience of the latest release is, especially bugs in need of fixing. As usual, you can reach out to us via IRC ([#newpipe on Libera.Chat](https://web.libera.chat/#newpipe)), [open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/new) or, ideally, use our built-in crash reporter to send us machine-readable issue reports. You can even [send in fixes](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-fixing) yourself.

If you have any other questions, feel free to post them in the comments here and someone will reply to you. Also, thanks for reading it until the end! We put quite some time into these blog posts.
