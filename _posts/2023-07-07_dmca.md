Hello everybody,

maybe you have already noticed it, maybe not: if you search "newpipe" on Google, you will find everything about us except the website. This is because Google accepted a DMCA request from the French company "Because Music" against our homepage, which means that from now on the landing page at newpipe.net will not show up in the Google search results. You can find the full DMCA [here in the Lumen database](https://lumendatabase.org/notices/34149383).
Well, so while this is not the worst thing that could happen to us, this is still rather nasty. Now fake NewPipe sites come up and our site may lose relevance. We are currently discussing whether to take legal actions against this DMCA.

If you are a lawyer and have experience with these kind of things and would like to help us, please contact us via email. (team(at)newpipe.net)

Regards,

Schabi
