We are happy to release NewPipe 0.16.0 bringing support for reading top-level YouTube comments. Moreover, with [media.ccc.de](https://media.ccc.de) NewPipe supports three services now!


<!-- more -->


## Comment support
[@yausername](https://github.com/yausername) implemented one of the most requested features: support for reading comments!

From now on, NewPipe can display comments underneath the video description. At the moment comment support is limited to reading top-level comments. But [@yausername](https://github.com/yausername) plans to extend it when he has some spare time left.

Nevertheless, NewPipe can and will only support reading comments, because any other activity like writing or up-/down-voting comments requires a YouTube account. For more on this topic, take a look at our [FAQ](/FAQ/bugs/).

As always, NewPipe tries to be as much customizable as possible. In case do not want to read comments at all, feel free to disable them in the content settings.

Along with adding the ability to view comments, [@yausername](https://github.com/yausername) added an autoplay toggle to the video pages. This allows you to easily turn on and off autoplay videos without going to the settings. You can find the toggle in the "related videos" tab by swiping the comment to the left.


## media.ccc.de service

[@theScrabi](https://github.com/theScrabi) completed the work he put into adding [media.ccc.de](https://media.ccc.de) before 35C3. As a result, you are now able to listen and watch to all the interesting conference records. To do so, open the navigation menu, change the service to `mediaCCC`. You can now either choose from a long list of conferences or just use the search. 

For those of you, who might not know the [Chaos Computer Club](https://www.ccc.de/en/), feel free take a look at their [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Computer_Club).

In case you miss a service and want to add it to NewPipe or are just interested how this can be done, please take a look at our documentation. [@theScrabi](https://github.com/theScrabi) has been constantly working on it the last few months. The docs are far from being perfect, so any feedback or help is welcome. At this point we'd like to thank [@snappyapple632](https://github.com/snappyapple632) for cleaning up and improving the docs slightly.

## Further improvements
[@clockworkant](https://github.com/clockworkant) added support for Amazon Fire TV virtual keyboard and [@nv95](https://github.com/nv95) made clearing history items easier.

Thanks to [@connectety](https://github.com/connectety), NewPipe can now open videos from `youtube-nocookie.com`.

[@Redirion](https://github.com/Redirion) improved NewPipe's interaction with Bluetooth devices: Receiving a notification while playing a stream via Bluetooth does not cause a delayed volume change anymore. Additionally, the artist and duration of a stream or song were added to the media description.

[@kapodamy](https://github.com/kapodamy) fixed a pop-up player crash which occurred when switching to the main player.
We also fixed the layout of the setting pages which do not contain any icons.

## Get the new version

We recommend you to install the [F-Droid app](https://f-droid.org/) as it notifies you as soon as an update for [NewPipe](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/) is available.
