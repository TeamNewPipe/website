So this is a "hot" fix, as they say. Since the previous post was so long (too long) this will be positively tiny in comparison. Let's dive right into it.

### YouTube

- Decryption error ("Could not load decryption code for the Youtube service."): When you try to open video details for any video, you could randomly encounter this error, because YouTube doesn't send over the relevant data. (YouTube is a bit moody like that.) We try to get that data three times before failing. That should fix the majority of these error messages.

- Search error ("Could not get ytInitialData"): When you enter a search term and tap enter, sometimes no search results are shown, and an error snackbar is shown at the bottom instead. (Maybe not moody, but shy?)

### SoundCloud

- Failing SoundCloud test: A reference account that NewPipe runs internal tests on changed its name at some point (sneaky sneaky!), causing those tests to fail. The name has been updated.

- Parsing of trailing slash: URLs which have a forward slash at the end are not supported consistently by SoundCloud, so NewPipe now removes it before using the URL for further processing.

That's it! Enjoy your day.
