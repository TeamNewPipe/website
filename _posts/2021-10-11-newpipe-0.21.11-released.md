This release is a hot fix one. You can import settings again, the long press menu got a new button with which you can now queue media directly after the current one and many changes to buttons. So many buttons. Like loads of buttons.

<!-- more -->
## New

- Did you ever carefully build an hour-long playlist by queuing songs after songs, just to realize that you actually want a specific song next? Previously that meant having to reorder the whole list manually, but [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) made this way quicker by adding a new button to the long press menu: You can enqueue something directly as the next media on the list! Thank you Stypox.

- NewPipe can now open the links from YouTube shorts directly. The code for this was already in the app, [@mhmdanas](https://github.com/mhmdanas) "just" gave you the ability to set NewPipe as the default app for these links as well.

- NewPipe Extractor (the code which works in the background of the app to serve you the content you want to see) got support for comment replies from YouTube by [@FireMasterK](https://github.com/FireMasterK). This is not yet visible in the app itself, but it could be soonish.


### Improved

Let's get to the buttons:

- [@Stypox](https://github.com/Stypox) made all buttons in the main player to have a better press animation/background. They also applied this change to a couple text buttons elsewhere in the app.

- Tired of not being able to hit the buttons in the minimized player because their hit range was so small? Well [@tsiflimagas](https://github.com/tsiflimagas) extended the clickable area of them, so even you can hit it now, big finger Joe.

- The buttons in the play queue view were moved below the seekbar. For once, it looks better this way, and it helps not accidentally hitting the seekbar when using gesture control. Thank [@phigjm](https://github.com/phigjm).

- If you enable the check for update options in the settings, NewPipe now searches immediately for updates. Faster updates for you thanks to [@evermind-zz](https://github.com/evermind-zz)
 

### Fixed

- Importing settings from older NewPipe versions kinda broke, and [@laksh-21](https://github.com/laksh-21) fixed that.

- [@litetex](https://github.com/litetex) fixed the seekbar for YouTube shorts.

- They also fixed some smaller behind-the-scenes issues, related to the thumbnail and other meta data of media. You will probably not notice these changes but they make the app just a smidge faster.

- [@Redirion](https://github.com/Redirion) fixed a buffering issue on RealtekATV.

- They fixed also a crash which could happen when sharing a livestream while the stream's title wasn't set correctly.


## Nerd Talk

- [@litetex](https://github.com/litetex) updated Android Gradle Plugin to version 7.0.2, which now requires Java 11 to build.

- [@XiangRongLin](https://github.com/XiangRongLin) made a change which allows passing a package name suffix through CLI.

- [@Jhooomn](https://github.com/Jhooomn) extracted a repeated variable to a constant.

- [@TacoTheDank](https://github.com/TacoTheDank) removed the deprecated preferenceTheme style attribute.

- They also regenerated some drawables to their latest design.

- And they updated Groupie library to 2.9.0.

- [@ygz213](https://github.com/ygz213) fixed several typos in READMEs.

- [@TobiGr](https://github.com/TobiGr) updated the SoundCloud client id, again.

- [@XiangRongLin](https://github.com/XiangRongLin) added a Gradle parameter to prevent KtLint, the Kotlin [linter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software))+[formatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prettyprint#Programming_code_formatting), from being run twice in the GitHub Actions [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration).

- dependabot updates (NewPipe Extractor):
  - Bump jsoup from 1.14.2 to 1.14.3


## Where to get this brand-new version

NewPipe notifies you about new versions. You can download them when you press the notification, which will take you to the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases).

If you use the [F-Droid app](https://f-droid.org/), it, too, notifies you about updates for [NewPipe](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/).
Please keep in mind that it can take F-Droid a while to update their repository. If you have problems installing the update, you may need to uninstall NewPipe and then install it afresh. (Make sure to backup data by exporting your database from the `Settings > Content` menu.)

If you already installed NewPipe from F-Droid’s repository, to get this version of NewPipe you can do one of the following:

* Wait for them to update
* Switch to NewPipe’s custom repository by following the [directions in the announcement post](https://newpipe.net/blog/announcement/f-droid/pinned/f-droid-repo/)

Note: If you installed NewPipe from GitHub Releases you will not have to uninstall NewPipe to switch to our custom repo. Just let it update your current version.
Make sure you back up your data as mentioned in the warning at the top of the FAQ page!

Now that you've (hopefully) updated, please let us know what your experience of the latest release is, especially bugs in need of fixing. As usual, you can reach out to us via IRC ([#newpipe on Libera.Chat](https://web.libera.chat/#newpipe)), [open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/new) or, ideally, use our built-in crash reporter to send us machine-readable issue reports. You can even [send in fixes](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-fixing) yourself.

If you have any other questions, feel free to post them in the comments here and someone will reply to you. Also, thanks for reading it till the end! We put quite some time into these blog posts.
