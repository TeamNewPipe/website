As announced in our [last post]({% post_url 2020-04-01-privacy-fixes %}), we planned to release another update this week. Unlike the April fools' blog post suggested, this update will not remove YouTube and SoundCloud support, but bring further improvements and fixes: the navigation sidebar received a small design update and two bugs were fixed.

## Navigation sidebar

[@mauriciocolli](https://github.com/mauriciocolli) once again brought improvements to NewPipe. This time, the navigation sidebar header received a small design and usability update. You can change services easier, because the complete sidebar header is waiting for you to be pressed to show the services list. On top of that he fixed a bug which occurred on devices with notches. Devices with notches come with a larger status bar. This caused big parts of the sidebar header to be hidden in the status bar.

## Further Improvements and Fixes

[@B0pol](https://github.com/B0pol) added the upload date and the view count to stream grid items to give tablet users more info about streams. [@Stypox](https://github.com/stypox) fixed a crash when opening the background or popup player queue. The lately added mute button caused the crashes on KitKat because the image was not resolved correctly on these old devices. [@kapodamy](https://github.com/kapodamy) fixed the postprocessing of large 1080p 60fps downloaded videos.

## Where to get the latest version

NewPipe notifies you about new versions, you can download them when you press the notification. An alternative is the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases). If you use the [F-Droid app](https://f-droid.org/), it notifies you as well about an update for [NewPipe](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/) - please keep in mind that it can take F-Droid a while to update their repository.

Please let us know what your experience of the latest release is, especially bugs in need of fixing. As usual, you can reach out to us via IRC ([#newpipe on Libera.Chat](ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697/newpipe)), [open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/new) or ideally use our built-in crash reporter to send us machine-readable issue reports. You can even [send in fixes](https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-fixing) yourself.
