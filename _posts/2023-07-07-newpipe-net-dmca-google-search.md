Dear NewPipe community and other beloved creatures,

You might have already noticed this: Searching "NewPipe" via Google will yield plenty information about the project, but a link to the official website is missing. This is because Google submitted to a DMCA takedown notice from a French record label, "Because Music". The notice demands removing our homepage [newpipe.net](https://newpipe.net) from their search listings along with a set of other domains completely unrelated to our project. The DMCA takedown notice was published [in the Lumen database](https://lumendatabase.org/notices/34149383) by Google themselves.

While worse things could have happened as the result of such a takedown request, Google's unlisting of our homepage creates a variety of problems. Given the fact that Google no longer counts visits to our site, it will lose relevance. As a result, websites for fake clones of NewPipe that mimic our homepage will tend to rank higher in the results. This could ultimately cause users to fall for such scams.

The team is currently discussing what to do about the situation. We are considering taking legal action. **If you are a lawyer and have experience with this and would like to help us, please contact us via email (team(at)newpipe.net).**


Regards,
Schabi
